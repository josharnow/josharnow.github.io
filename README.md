# My Personal Website

Welcome to the repo for my personal site! 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```
The flag is necessary to work around false positives for dependency conflicts due to using Release Candidate versions of React 19 and Next.js 15.


Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses IBM Plex Sans, an open-source font. I opted not to use the Google Fonts version because it doesn't exist as a variable font, so I instead used a `woff2` file from [this](https://github.com/IBM/plex) official repo.
